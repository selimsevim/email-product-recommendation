# Progressive Hybrid Recommendation System
This repository implements a progressive recommendation system that combines a cold-start collaborative filtering model with online learning and persistent user queues. The system is designed to adapt over time by incorporating new browsing events (views, carts, removals, and purchases) while preserving historical knowledge and enforcing business rulesâ€”such as not recommending or storing purchased products.

## Overview
This system consists of two major components:

1. Training (Cold-Start):
	- Uses historical browsing data to build a collaborative filtering model and create user and product mappings.
2. Inference and Online Updates:
	- Loads the cold model and applies online updates with new (delta) data.
	- Generates personalized recommendations and maintains a persistent recommendation queue for each user.
	- Enforces rules so that purchased products are never recommended or stored.

## Dataset
This project uses the E-commerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop dataset from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop

### Key details about the dataset:

- **Domain:** E-commerce events in a cosmetics shop.
- **Data Coverage:** The dataset includes historical event data capturing various user interactions.
- **Event Types:**

	1. **View:** Indicates a product was viewed.
	2. **Cart:** Indicates a product was added to the shopping cart.
	3. **Remove_from_cart:** Indicates a product was removed from the cart.
	4. **Purchase:** Indicates a product was purchased.

- **Key Columns:**
	- **user_id**: Identifier for the user.
	- **product_id**: Identifier for the product.
	- **event_time**: Timestamp for when the event occurred.
	- **event_type**: Type of event (e.g., view, cart, purchase).

- **Usage:**- 
	The dataset is used to simulate real-world user interactions. Historical events are processed for cold-start model training, and new (delta) events are used for online updates during inference, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant over time.

This dataset provides a realistic foundation for building and testing dynamic recommendation systems in an e-commerce context.

## Architecture and Data Flow

|  Component |  Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Data Sources	 |  Browsing CSV files with user interactions and timestamps. |
| Historical Data	  |  Used by **training.py** to build the cold model and mappings.|
| Delta Data	  | New events detected since the last update, used for online training in **inference.py.**|
| Model Updates	  | Online training updates the model weights, which are then saved for future inferences.  |
|  Persistent Queue	 | A SQLite database (**recommendation.db**) stores user-specific recommendation pools (queues).  |

## Model and Recommendation Logic

### Collaborative Filtering Model

**- User and Product Embeddings:**
The model learns embeddings for users and products.

**- Fully Connected Layers:**
Concatenated embeddings are passed through a series of layers to produce a purchase probability.

**- Recommendation Function:**
Scores all products for a given user and returns the top-K recommendations.

### Predefined Scoring Rules

| Event  |  Score Change |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| View  |  +1 |
| Cart  | +3  |
|  Remove from Cart |  -1 |
| Purchase	  |  (Used to remove items from pool) |

## Persistent User Queue and Database

- Database:
A SQLite database (recommendation.db) stores each user's recommendation queue in JSON format.
- Queue Format:
Each queue is a dictionary with a key "pool" that holds a list of items:
[productID, counter, score]
- Rules Enforced:
Do Not Recommend Purchased Products
Do Not Add Purchased Products to the Queue
Remove Purchased Products from the Queue
